This folder contains an example set of hdf images for evaluation with
"rctopo" to perform rocking curve imaging.

in this particular case images are collected on the rocking curve of a
type IIa diamond single crystal.

to perform quick evaluation run:
rctopo -t 1.1 -s -u deg *hdf

to obtain smooth image perform Gaussian fitting for each pixel:
rctopo -t 1.1 -g -s -u deg *hdf

to assign sample name to the image title on the results figure run:
rctopo -t 1.1 -g -s -u deg -n diamond1 *hdf

to perform statistical analysis and visualization over a specified region
run:
rctopo -r '1.5 3.5 4 6' -t 1.1 -g -s -u deg -n diamond1 *hdf
