Tools for X-ray diffraction evaluation of single crystals

Provides
########

* :ref:`dtxrd`	      : calculations of reflectivity/transmissivity using the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction 
* :ref:`rcpeak`       : plotting and calculations of parameters of a reflectivity curve
* :ref:`rctopo`       : calculations of x-ray rocking curve images (for a series of hdf4 CCD snapshots)
* :ref:`seehdf`       : hdf4 image data viewer
* :ref:`specscan`     : extraction of individual scans from a file generated by SPEC
* :ref:`throughput`   : calculations of a throughput and rocking curves of a multicrystal configuration 
* :ref:`flux`         : calculate x-ray flux based on a scaler count rate, a amplifier gain (sensitivity) and a detector responsivity
