Tools for X-ray diffraction evaluation of single crystals

Provides
########

* :ref:`dtxrd`	      : calculations of reflectivity/transmissivity using the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction 
* :ref:`rcpeak`       : plotting and statistics of a reflectivity (rocking) curve
* :ref:`rctopo`       : x-ray rocking curve topography
* :ref:`rctopo-fast`  : accelerated x-ray rocking curve topography
* :ref:`seehdf`       : HDF4 and HDF5 image data viewer
* :ref:`specscan`     : extraction of individual scans from a SPEC data file
* :ref:`throughput`   : calculations of a throughput and rocking curves of a multicrystal configuration 
* :ref:`flux`         : calculate x-ray flux based on a scaler count rate, a amplifier gain (sensitivity) and a detector responsivity
* :ref:`crl`          : x-ray compound refractive lens calculator
